        <p>I am a hardworking creative mind that enjoys rolling up my sleeves and finding solutions to design challenges. I have been working as a graphic designer for 5+ years now and have recently started my adventure into the realm of UX/UI design. I am looking for an environment 
          to grow my experience as a UX/UI designer and stretch my creative capabilities. I have built a solid foundation for my career and I am searching for an opportunity to elevate myself as an individual and as an artist.
